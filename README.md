# druid_mvp
personal navigation MVP Capstone draft


A computer vision-based navigation app  which highlights important objects such as stop signs, traffic lights, and pedestrians. Traffic lights and stop signs are displayed as icons for better visibility next to the current speed.

This app requires XCode to install. To get started, clone this repository, open the project with DruidMvp.xcodeproj and build it. Then connect your iPhone and select your iPhone under "device" in XCode and install the app. Make sure you select a valid profile under Signing & Capabilities, otherwise the app wonâ€™t compile.
